# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview

This repo contains code to complete the course project for class 3 in Coursera's Data Science specialization: Getting and Cleaning Data.

## Code

There is one relevant file, `run_analysis.R` that runs several analyses (detailed in `CodeBook.md`) and outputs tidy data file `tidy.txt`

## Assumptions

This code makes no assumptions! (beyond that a somewhat recent version of `dplyr` is installed)

The dataset is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, unzipped to `UCI HAR Dataset` and processed as described in the `code` section above.
